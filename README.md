### Images evolution using genetic algorithm


## Algorithm Overview
The implemented genetic algorithm leverages the principles of genetic evolution to recreate images using triangles. It starts with a population of individuals,
each representing an image through a genetic code with locations and colors of triangles. These individuals undergo selection, crossover, and mutation,
evolving over generations to improve their fitness - measured by how closely their generated images match the original. The algorithm operates until a specified number of iterations or a set time limit,
continually refining the population. Additionally, it offers the option to introduce an extra fitness component that can reduce triangle sizes,
further enhancing image accuracy and showcasing the adaptability of genetic algorithms in creative tasks.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/CyperStone/evolving-images.git
```
2. Create and activate new environment with Python 3.10 (example with using Anaconda):
```
conda create -n myenv python=3.10
conda activate myenv
```
3. Install required packages:
```
conda install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
To run the algorithm simply use the following command:
```
python run.py [ARGUMENTS]
```
With an option to set the following arguments:
```
required arguments:
  -i, --image_filename IMAGE_FILENAME      input image filename (must be placed in ./inputs) directory
optional arguments:
  --n_iter N_ITER                          number of algorithm iterations (generations)
  --n_seconds N_SECONDS                    duration of algorithm execution (in seconds)
  --no_animation                           do not save an evolution progress as a GIF animation
  --img_history_step IMG_HISTORY_STEP      frequency at which algorithm outputs are included in the GIF animation(e.g. 10 for every 10th iteration)
```
Feel free to play with the algorithm parameters (e.g. enable a penalty for big triangle sizes) in `config.py`
